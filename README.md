<img src="https://app.travis-ci.com/Rod1Andrade/voting-app.svg?branch=main" alt="Travis CI status">

The voting application is a full stack application based on the [AppIdeas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Voting-App.md) Repository.

## Backend

The backend ``API`` is built using **PHP 8.0** without a framework.

```json
"require": {
	"php": ">=8.0",
	"rodri/simple-router": "v1.3.3-alpha",
	"vlucas/phpdotenv": "^5.3",
	"ramsey/uuid": "*",
	"firebase/php-jwt": "^5.4"
},
"require-dev": {
	"phpunit/phpunit": "^9.5",
	"phpunit/php-code-coverage": "*"
},
```

### Disclaimer

The [``rodri/simple-router``](https://github.com/Rod1Andrade/simple-router) is a dependency I developed to learn about routing and HTTP requests.
